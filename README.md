Basic Patient Appointment System for Veterinary Clinic
This system allows veterinary clinic staff to manage patient (pet) information, schedule appointments, and handle the overall management of the appointment process. The system is implemented in C language and is structured into three milestones that progressively enhance the functionality of the system.

Milestone 1: Patient Contact Information Management
The first milestone focuses on storing and managing the pet’s (patient's) contact information. This typically includes:

Pet Owner's Information: Name, contact number, address.
Pet Information: Pet’s name, type (dog, cat, etc.), breed, age, and medical history.
Using arrays or structures in C, this milestone allows users to enter, view, and update basic contact details of the pet and its owner.

Milestone 2: Appointment Scheduling
The second milestone adds the ability to schedule appointments for pets. Key functionalities include:

Appointment Details: Date and time of the appointment, type of visit (e.g., routine checkup, vaccination, emergency).
Assigning Veterinarian: The system can assign a specific veterinarian to an appointment.
Appointment Status: The system can track whether an appointment is pending, completed, or canceled.
A simple menu allows clinic staff to select an available time slot, confirm with the pet owner, and store this information in the system.

Milestone 3: Appointment Management and History
The final milestone focuses on managing appointments and keeping track of appointment history. This includes:

View Upcoming Appointments: The system allows staff to see a list of all upcoming appointments, and manage cancellations or rescheduling.
Appointment History: Past appointments can be reviewed, including the services provided, and any notes or medical records.
Search Functionality: Staff can search for an appointment by pet name, owner name, or date.
Additionally, features like data validation, error handling, and file storage can be added to ensure that the system is robust and can save appointment data to files.

Key Features:
Contact Management: Efficient storage and retrieval of pet and owner contact details.
Appointment Scheduling: Intuitive scheduling system with easy-to-view time slots and veterinarian assignments.
Appointment History: Organized history of all appointments, making it easy to track the health progress of pets over time.
Data Storage: Persistence of patient and appointment data using file handling.
