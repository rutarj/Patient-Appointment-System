# Patient Appointment System

**Patient Appointment System** is a veterinary clinic management tool developed in C that allows staff to efficiently manage pet information, schedule appointments, and track appointment histories. The system is built in three milestones, evolving in complexity while maintaining simplicity for ease of use.

## Basic Patient Appointment System for Veterinary Clinic

This C-based system enables veterinary clinic staff to manage patient (pet) details, schedule appointments, and maintain an appointment history. The system evolves in three milestones:

### Milestone 1: Patient Contact Information Management
The first milestone focuses on managing essential pet and owner information:
- **Owner Information:** Name, contact number, and address
- **Pet Information:** Pet’s name, type (dog, cat, etc.), breed, age, and medical history

Using structures and arrays, staff can **add**, **view**, and **update** pet and owner details with ease.

### Milestone 2: Appointment Scheduling
The second milestone introduces an intuitive scheduling system, where clinic staff can:
- **Set Appointment Details:** Date, time, and visit type (checkup, vaccination, etc.)
- **Assign Veterinarian:** Each appointment is assigned a veterinarian.
- **Track Appointment Status:** Status options include pending, completed, or canceled.

This milestone allows easy scheduling and updating of appointments.

### Milestone 3: Appointment Management & History
The final milestone adds comprehensive appointment management:
- **View Upcoming Appointments:** Easy access to upcoming appointments for efficient planning.
- **Track Appointment History:** Staff can review past appointments and services provided.
- **Search Appointments:** Quickly find appointments by pet name, owner name, or date.

Additional features include **data validation**, **error handling**, and **file storage** for persistent patient and appointment data.
